### Why use a framework?

This month we are going talk about why you might want to use a framework (or not), some of issues with building real products with them, and highlight some key features of some of the more popular ones.

This meetup will be split into two parts. The first half-hour will be about a beginner focussed topic and in the second part we will step it up a notch and do something more advanced. This time:

1) Frameworks?

* What Frameworks are out there?
* What are the benefits?
* What are the drawbacks?
* No framework

2) Making Instaface with CanJS

* We're going to convert our app to using CanJS.
